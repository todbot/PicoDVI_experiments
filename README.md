# PicoDVI_experiments

Experiments using PicoDVI (mostly on Adafruit DVI RP2040 Feather),

These demos all use [Adafruit's PicoDVI fork](https://github.com/adafruit/PicoDVI/)
that makes the video framebuffer look like a regular
[Adafruit_GFX object](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/).
(thx @PaintYourDragon!)
This makes drawing to it really easy.
